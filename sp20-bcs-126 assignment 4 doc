Q1: Provide responses to the following questions about the dataset.
1. How many instances does the dataset contain?
   80
2. How many input attributes does the dataset contain?
   7
3. How many possible values does the output attribute have?
   2
4. How many input attributes are categorical?
   2 (Hair and Color)
5. What is the class ratio (male vs female) in the dataset?
   46 male vs 34 female (46:34->23:17->1.35:1)
  
Q2: Apply Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Multilayer Perceptron classification algorithms
(using Python) on the gender prediction dataset with standard train/test split ratio and answer the following
questions.
1. How many instances are incorrectly classified?
i) 0
ii) 6
iii) 10
2. Rerun the experiment using train/test split ratio of 80/20. Do you see any change in the results?
Explain.
i) No,because there are some input atributes which are heavily impacting the output.
ii) Yes,3 instances are wrong now.
iii) Yes, 3 instances are wrong now
3. Name 2 attributes that you believe are the most “powerful” in the prediction task. Explain why?
   In my opinion, beard and hair, as a female can't have beard or be bald.
4. Try to exclude these 2 attribute(s) from the dataset. Rerun the experiment (using 80/20 train/test split),
did you find any change in the results? Explain.
i) No, because there might be other powerful attributes than excluded ones, or that there is a lot of data with not much vareity.
ii) No, because there might be other powerful attributes than excluded ones, or that there is a lot of data with not much vareity.
iii) Yes, 6 instances are wrong now.
